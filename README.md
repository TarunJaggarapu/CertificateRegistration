# CertificateRegistration

Hi Everyone, Basically it is a web app where users can register their Azure, GCP, AWS certifications with certificate image.

Used Languages: Front-end: HTML, CSS, Javascript Back-end: PHP and Firebase, Used GCP Services Compute engine, Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL, Cloud Functions

Function: Upon creating the web application, we have to host in cloud service virtual machines and sql database. 
Upon connection between virtual machine and cloud sql, we can use databse for storing the certificate details. 
And we have used cloud functions to send email when any certification is added or delelted. And also user can search and delete their certifications.
